The rendering of volumetric effects such as refraction presents great challenge for rendering on the GPU. As the modern GPU is highly specialised towards rasterisation, a method of rendering that only considers the surfaces of objects being rendered, it is challenging to simulate effects that need to consider the interior of volumes in real-time.

This paper investigates methods of real-time volume rendering in the GPU that are capable of considering these volumetric effects, as well as the flexible encoding of heterogeneous volumetric structures. We present a real-time GPU-based 3D renderer capable of considering volumetric effects using an octree structure and ray tracing.
