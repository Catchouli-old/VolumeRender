Physics Sandbox

Run the program and go to File > Open to open one of the three samples (car, bike and tank.)

Control the car/tank with W/S for forwards/backwards.
The bike has an additional control: Use A/D to tip the rider forwards and back to shift the centre of mass.

This submission implements basic rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, based on the formulas in the spec, and traction using box2d's physics and the relationship between physical attributes.
